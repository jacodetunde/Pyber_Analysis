# Pyber_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is the following: 
- To create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type.
- To use pandas and matplotlib to a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
- Infer from the chart how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
## Results
#### Data summary
The cities were grouped into cities type(Rural, Suburban, and Urban) to get the total number of rides, drivers, and fares in each city type.
The analysis shows that total rides in Rural, Suburban, and Urban cities are 125, 625, and 1,625 respectively. ![pyber_summary_df.png](path/to/pyber_summary.png)
The total drivers in rural, Suburban, and Urban cities are 537, 8,570, and 59,602 respectively.
The total fares of rides in Rural is $4,327.93, while Suburban and Urban are $19,356.33 and  $39,854.38 respectively.
accordingly.
 The average fare by Ride are as follows:
- Rural cities – $34.62 per ride
- Suburban cities - $30.97 per ride
- Urban cities - $24.53 per ride
- The average Fare per driver are as follows:
- Rural cities - $8.06 per driver
- Suburban cities – $2.26 per driver
- Urban cities - $0.67 per driver


#### Chart
The data were grouped by city type and date to observe the trend of the total fare in each city type between January 2019 and April 2019.
The chart shows that the results show that, Urban cities had the highest total fares, followed by Suburban and Rural.![jan_april.png](path/to/jan_april.png)
The last week of February was the peak of total fare in suburban cities. While Rural cities have the highest total fare in the first week of April. The last week of February and the second week of March is the second week of March shows to be the highest points of total fares in Urban cities.

## Summary
From the analysis, it shows that Urban cities have the highest Total fares, Rides, and Drivers. This indicates that Urban cities are the most profitable hubs for This can be due to the larger population in the Urban cities. However, there are tendencies of drivers in Urban cities getting discouraged as more drivers enter the business, the average revenue of the drivers will decline. 
It is important for the PyBer to find a way of incentivizing the drivers. 
Incentives can be done in two ways: PyBer advertises more, to increase the number of users in order to increase total rides. Or increase the fare per ride.
Suburban cities show to be an emerging market for  PyBer. Though the population of suburban may not be as high as Urban cities, more advertisement can be done in Suburban cities close to Urban cities to drive traffic to PyBer most especially among the college students and professionals that work in urban cities but reside in suburban or work in suburban and reside in rural.
The lower rides and drivers in rural could be due to lower populations of riders in rural cities. However, the higher average fare per driver can encourage more drivers to use PyBer app but may discourage the riders from using the app. Based on this, PyBer may lower the ride’s fare in Rural cities to encourage more users of the app.

Finally, from the charts total fares are higher in the last week of February and last week of March in all the cities type. This may indicate that there are more rides in those weeks of the month. It may be due to holiday or weather conditions. PyBer should investigate further into the reason for the peak in those weeks.
In general, the movement pattern of the trend shows a relatively weekly seasonal trend from January to early 2019.
