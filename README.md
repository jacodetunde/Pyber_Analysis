# Pyber_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this anlysis are the following: 
- To create summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type.
- To use pandas and matplotlib to a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
- Infer from the chart how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
